# ✨ 1. Introduction

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Assets_For_ReadMe/oriamforreport.gif" alt="Oiram Game" width="50">
</div>

In designing our game, we set out to create a historically immersive tower defense experience that is both engaging and educational. Our vision was to craft a game that combines strategy , progression , and cultural significance , allowing players to explore the rich history of Bristol while defending the city from various threats  across different time periods .

## A Unique Twist on Tower Defense 
Unlike traditional tower defense games that focus only on mechanics, our game integrates historical storytelling into the experience. Spanning multiple eras, from the medieval period to the high-tech future, players take on the role of a Guardian , defending Bristol from invading armies, pirate raids, and cyber warfare across time.

-  **Invading armies**  
- **Pirate raids**  
-  **High-tech cyber warfare**  

 Get ready to **defend, strategize, and experience history like never before!**

##  Knight Mechanic: Absorbing Tower Abilities   

 To tackle the common lack of player interaction in tower defense games, we introduced a medieval knight  who can absorb a tower’s ability  by staying nearby for 5 seconds . The knight then fights alongside the tower, adding a dynamic and strategic layer as players guide him between different towers to combine powers and defeat enemies.

# 🎯 2. Requirements  

##  Ideation Process - Game Concept Development 

### Early Brainstorming & Game Ideas  
During **Week 2**, our team (**which initially had 6 members**) brainstormed **two potential game concepts**:  

1. **Tower Defense Game**  
   - A **historical tower defense game**, integrating **different defense strategies across various eras**.  
   - Players would be able to **place, upgrade, and manage towers** to defend against invaders from different time periods (e.g., knights , pirates , futuristic AI robots ).  

2. **Aircraft Shooter Game**  
   - A **classic aerial shooter**, where players pilot an aircraft to **engage in air combat and eliminate enemies**.  
   - The game would feature multiple historical settings (e.g., **WWI, WWII, modern warfare, and futuristic battles**).  

### Paper Prototype Development  
To better understand and test the game mechanics, we created two paper prototypes  for this as part of the early validation process：
- #### Tower Defense Game Paper Prototype  
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-11b/blob/main/Early%20Design.gif" 
       alt="Tower Defense Paper Prototype" 
       width="500" 
       style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

- #### Aircraft Shooter Game Paper Prototype  
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-11b/blob/main/fly.gif" 
       alt="Aircraft Shooter Paper Prototype" 
       width="500" 
       style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

### How We Decided as a Team What to Develop  (**which initially had 6 members**) 

- Open Brainstorming Sessions:  
  We first conducted open discussions where every team member pitched ideas, focusing on gameplay mechanics, target audiences, and possible historical or educational elements.

- Paper Prototype Feedback:  
  We created paper prototypes (see below) for both the Tower Defense Game and the Aircraft Shooter Game. By testing these prototypes in small play sessions, we gathered direct feedback on fun factor, ease of learning, and potential for expansion.

- Feasibility & Resource Assessment:  
  Given our team size and the complexity of each concept, we weighed the required development effort (e.g., coding complexity, art assets, AI pathfinding) against our available skills and time constraints.  
  The Tower Defense concept was deemed more feasible due to clearer scope definition and manageable AI requirements.

- Stakeholder & Audience Considerations:  
  We referred to our Onion Model of Stakeholders to anticipate who would be most invested in each idea. We also considered which concept might have broader appeal and educational potential.

- Final Team Vote & Milestone Check:  
  After considering feedback, testing the paper prototypes, and reviewing our resources, the team held a final vote. We chose the Tower Defense concept.



### Onion Model of Stakeholders  

To better visualize the relationship between different stakeholders in our game project, we created an **Onion Model** to represent their roles and levels of involvement.

The model illustrates four concentric layers:  

- The innermost layer represents the **Players**, who directly interact with the game system.  
- The second layer includes the **Core Development Team** — Designers, Developers, Artists, and QA Testers — who build and test the game.  
- The third layer consists of the **Support & Management Team** — Project Managers, Sound Designers, and Community Moderators — who ensure project progress and community engagement.  
- The outermost layer features **External Stakeholders** — Marketing Team, Investors, Publishers, and Potential Partners — who promote, fund, and expand the game's reach.

  <b>Figure 4</b><br>
  <i>Onion Model</i>
</p>


###  Identify Top-Level User Needs

After analysing the project context and stakeholders' needs, we identified the top-level user requirements (Epics) that would guide our game development:

- Epic 1: Provide engaging gameplay with progressive difficulty.
- Epic 2: Allow players to explore historical periods through gameplay.
- Epic 3: Offer a variety of towers and enemy types to ensure diversity and replayability.
- Epic 4: Optimize game performance and stability across different devices.
- Epic 5: Create a scalable backend and infrastructure to support future updates and multiplayer functionality.


###  User Stories & Stakeholders

In this phase, we identified the key **stakeholders** whose input and needs would directly influence the game's development. Our goal was to ensure the game appealed to a broad audience—both users and creators. The key stakeholders we focused on were:

- **Players**: The main users who play the game.
- **Game Designers**: Those who design levels and mechanics.
-  **Developers**: Programmers implementing the game.
-  **QA Testers**: People testing for bugs and balance.
-  **Artists**: Designers of game assets (characters, towers, environment).
-  **Sound Designers**: Those who create sound effects and music.
-  **Project Managers**: Oversee development progress.
-  **Marketing Team**: Promote the game to players.
-  **Investors/Publishers**: Fund the project.
-  **Community Moderators**: Manage player discussions and feedback.

As we refined our ideas, we began developing **user stories** to ensure that our vision aligned with the experiences we wanted to deliver. These stories were crafted in **collaboration** with developers, designers, and artists, incorporating a variety of perspectives to make sure we were covering all aspects of the game.

  <b>Figure 5</b><br>
  <i>Stakeholder Requirements</i>
</p>

###  Specify Atomic Requirements  

To further refine our user needs, we specified atomic requirements based on our user stories. These requirements are clear, testable, and independent to ensure traceability and system verification.

#### Example Atomic Requirements:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| AR-01 | The system shall allow the player to place a tower on an empty grid. | Given the player has enough resources, when they select a grid, then the tower should be placed successfully. |
| AR-02 | The system shall allow the player to upgrade a tower to increase its attack damage. | Given the player selects an existing tower, when they choose upgrade, then the tower’s attack stats should increase. |
| AR-03 | The system shall spawn enemy waves with increasing difficulty. | Given the player starts a new wave, when the wave spawns, then enemy stats (speed, health, number) should increase. |
| AR-04 | The system shall display earned in-game currency when enemies are defeated. | Given an enemy is defeated, when the player views their resources, then the currency value should update accordingly. |

###  Early Design & Prototyping  

 Research & Conceptualization
In the early stages of design, we researched traditional tower defense games to understand their mechanics and identify potential areas for innovation. Our key decision was to merge tower defense gameplay with the historical evolution of Bristol 🏛️, offering players the opportunity to enjoy strategic gameplay while also learning about the city's history.

 Core Gameplay Design
Once the core game concept was defined, we focused on establishing the key gameplay pillars. For example, tower placement would be strategically important, with different historical periods unlocking unique towers and monsters. We also aimed to incorporate Bristol's historical landmarks as key gameplay elements, enhancing both the strategic depth and the educational value of the game.

 Technical Considerations
To ensure the game met these design goals, we considered the system's technical requirements. The game needed to be accessible across multiple platforms (PC, console, and web) , allowing players to engage seamlessly. The user interface was designed to be intuitive, facilitating easy tower placement, upgrades, and resource management.

 Prototype Development
With these concepts in mind, we developed an early prototype, testing core mechanics such as grid-based tower placement, monster AI pathfinding, and resource management. These tests validated our ideas and ensured that the game could progress to full-scale development with a solid foundation.

# 3. Design: System Architecture & Diagrams
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983aecaf-989a-40e7-854f-ed215df4eed7)

## 📦 Class Diagram Explanation – Tower Defense Game

This class diagram illustrates the structure and interactions between major components in a tower defense game system, including monsters, towers, and the game map.

---

### 🔷 Class: `main` (Manager Class)

This is a **controller/manager** class for managing entities in the game such as monsters, bullets, towers, and paths.

#### Attributes:
- `monsters`, `newMonsters`: Arrays managing current and incoming monsters.
- `bullets`, `newBullets`: Arrays for handling bullet instances.
- `towers`, `newTowers`: Tower entities.
- `particle`: Handles particle effects (e.g., explosions).
- `paths`: Movement paths for monsters.
- `wave`, `cash`, `health`: Game state indicators.

#### Methods:
- `dealDamage(x, y)`, `attack(monster)`: Core game logic for combat.
- `draw()`, `shake()`, `update()`, `move()`: Visual or state update logic.
- `onKilled(monster)`, `ifDie()`: Death handling for monsters.

---

### 🏰 Class: `Tower`

Represents a defense tower placed by the player.

#### Attributes:
- Boolean flags for visuals and logic: `baseOnTop`, `drawLine`, `length`, `radius`, `type`
- Vectors and arrays: `color`, `pos`
- Stats: `cost`, `damageMin`, `damageMax`

#### Methods:
- `rotate(x,y)`, `attack(monster)`, `onTarget(monster)`: Tower targeting and firing logic.
- `draw()`, `destroy()`, `initialize()`, `sell()`, `resetCd()`: Rendering and lifecycle functions.

---

### 👾 Class: `monster` (Entity Class)

This is the **individual monster entity**, separate from the manager class.

#### Attributes:
- Identity and state: `name`, `health`, `cash`, `speed`, `color`
- Visuals and animation: `frameIndex`, `frameCount`, `animationSpeed`, `facingRight`
- Position: `pos`

#### Methods:
Same as manager's monster logic:
- `dealDamage(x,y)`, `attack(monster)`, `draw()`, `move()`, `update()`
- `ifDie()`, `onKilled(monster)`, `shake()`

---
### 🗺️ Class: `map`

Represents the level layout and environment configuration.

#### Attributes:
- `customMap`: Full map configuration object.
- `grid`, `paths`, `metadata`, `spawnpoints`, `exitArray`: Layout and logic elements.
- Dimensions: `bgArray`, `cols`, `rows`

---

### 🔁 Class Relationships

- The `monster` manager **controls** both `Tower` and individual `monster` entities.
- The `map` is **loaded** and referenced by the `monster` manager.
- Towers **attack** individual `monster` entities.
- The manager class `monster` is distinct from the monster instance class `monster`.

---

### 🧠 Notes

- There is a separation between **game state management (controller)** and **entity objects**.
- The system uses arrays to manage dynamic entities like bullets and monsters.
- Inheritance is not shown; composition and control logic dominate.

## 🧩 Tower Defense Game - Sequence Explanation

### 1. Tower Placement

- The **User** selects and places a tower.
- The **GameLoop** initializes the tower by adding it to the `towers` array.

---

### 2. Game Loop Updates

The **GameLoop** continuously runs, updating each frame:

- **Monster** moves and updates its state.
- If the monster exits the map, it triggers a **health decrease**.
- **Tower** targets nearby monsters and updates its state.

---

### 3. Tower Attacks

- The **Tower** chooses the nearest monster as a target.
- A **bullet is spawned** via `bullets.push()`.
- The **Bullet** is updated via `steer()` and `update()` functions.

---

### 4. Collision & Explosion

- The **GameLoop** checks if the bullet hits the target using `reachedTarget()`.
- If hit:
  - The **bullet explodes** and is **destroyed**.
  - A **visual particle effect** is triggered via `particle.run()`.

---

### 5. Wave Check

If all monsters are defeated (`noMoreMonster()` returns `true`), the system:

- Checks for **wave completion**.
- Starts the **next wave** by calling `nextWave()`.



# 4. Implementation

feat: Implement game structure and core components

- Researched similar games and decided to divide the game into four main components: **map, towers, monsters, and the main interface**.
- Created four separate classes: **maps.js, tower.js, monster.js, and main.js**.
- Implemented core functionalities:
  - **Placing, purchasing, selling, and upgrading towers**.
  - **Pausing, starting, and resetting the game**.
  - **Speeding up monster movement**.
  - **Exiting and switching to the team interface**.

## Challenges

### 1. Multi-resolution Support and Complex UI Interaction

One of the most significant challenges we encountered during the development was ensuring that our game could properly support multiple screen resolutions while maintaining the integrity of a complex user interface. The game includes interactive UI elements such as a tower selection panel, a scrollable information bar, and paginated navigation buttons. In the early stages of development, we used hardcoded pixel-based coordinates for positioning UI elements. While this approach worked initially on our target resolution, it quickly became problematic when tested on devices with different screen sizes or aspect ratios. UI components would become misaligned, clipped, or overlapping, severely impacting usability. To address this, we refactored the layout system to rely on relative positioning and scaling, often using percentage-based anchors and layout groups provided by our game engine. We also incorporated a dynamic resolution manager that could adjust element spacing, font size, and margins in real-time. This significantly improved the consistency of the user experience across various devices and resolutions, though it required a considerable redesign of our original UI structure.

#### 1.1 Initial Use of Static HTML and UI Loading Order Issues

The first challenge arose from our initial decision to build the game's interface using static HTML pages. While this approach allowed for rapid prototyping and easier organization of UI components, it introduced a noticeable issue during the game's loading phase. Specifically, we observed that the sidebar UI—containing menus and options—would render on the screen before the main game canvas was fully initialized. This led to a disjointed user experience where players would momentarily see an incomplete or partially loaded interface, which gave the impression of a performance issue or a broken layout.

  <i>use html instead of p5</i>
</p>

To address this issue, I decided to abandon the use of static HTML altogether and refactored all UI pages into a unified p5.js-based interface. By relying solely on p5 for both game logic and UI rendering, we eliminated the premature rendering problem caused by HTML loading separately from the game canvas. This integration ensured that all elements appeared simultaneously and consistently once the canvas was fully initialized.

However, this change introduced a new challenge. Since the entire interface was now rendered through p5, its appearance became highly sensitive to browser-specific scaling behaviors and screen DPI settings. In different browsers or under varying resolution and zoom configurations, the sidebar layout could shift, scale inconsistently, or even overflow the visible canvas area. These discrepancies posed a new threat to the visual stability we had just achieved and required us to implement additional logic to detect screen resolution and zoom level, and dynamically adjust the canvas scale and element positions accordingly.

#### 1.2 Final Unified Rendering Solution and Adaptive Scaling Strategy
To ensure a consistent and responsive user experience across a wide range of screen sizes and aspect ratios, we implemented a dynamic resolution adaptation strategy using p5.js. At the core of this approach is the calculation of a scalable tile size (ts), which is derived based on the current window dimensions and the predefined grid size (12 columns by 8 rows). This ensures that all map elements maintain their proportions and remain visually aligned across different devices.

The game dynamically computes the canvas dimensions by multiplying the tile size with the number of columns and rows, and then recenters the canvas on screen using calculated offsets (gameX and gameY). This allows the game view to remain centered and properly scaled regardless of window size. UI components such as buttons, panels, and fonts are also scaled proportionally using a scaling factor derived from the tile size, ensuring a unified appearance.

Furthermore, we utilize the windowResized() function to listen for screen changes in real time. Whenever the window is resized, the canvas is updated, UI elements are re-rendered, and layout parameters are recalculated to maintain consistency. This approach offers a resolution-independent, pixel-perfect layout that avoids layout breaks and maintains usability across devices, including mobile and ultra-wide screens.

#### 2. Frame Animation Design
1. Frame Rate Optimization
- Choosing the right frame rate is crucial to balance smoothness and performance.
- Too low FPS results in choppy animations, while too high FPS can cause performance issues.

2. Sprite Sheet Management
- Efficiently organizing sprite sheets to reduce memory usage and rendering time.
- Ensuring correct frame alignment to avoid misalignment when drawing.
- Handling different frame sizes dynamically.

3. Directional Animations
- Designing animations for multiple directions (e.g., left, right, up, down).
- Avoiding redundant frames by flipping sprites instead of drawing extra frames.

4. Animation Timing and Synchronization
- Controlling frame transitions smoothly based on speed or events.
- Synchronizing animations with game physics (e.g., running, attacking, jumping).
- Ensuring consistent playback across different devices.

5. State Transitions and Blending
- Handling smooth transitions between animations (e.g., walking to running to idle).
- Avoiding sudden jumps or unnatural movements.
- Implementing animation blending for fluid motion.

### 📊 How We Track Progress in Our Tower Defense Game Project

#### ✅ Sprint Reviews and Demos

At the end of each sprint, we organize a **sprint review** where the development team presents the current version of the tower defense game to stakeholders — including instructors, testers, or team leads. This typically includes:

- Demonstrating newly implemented features (e.g., new tower types, monster behaviors, improved map interactions).
- Gathering feedback on gameplay feel, UI/UX elements, and feature completeness.
- Identifying what to refine or reprioritize for the next sprint.

#### 📉 Burndown Charts and Velocity Tracking

We use a **burndown chart** to visualize our progress throughout each sprint. The chart plots the amount of remaining work (in story points or tasks) against time. As tasks (e.g., "implement tower firing", "create wave logic", "add hero animation") are completed, the line trends downward.

Additionally, we track **team velocity**, which is the number of story points completed in each sprint. This helps us:

- Estimate future workload and sprint capacity.
- Adjust scope when we're ahead or behind.
- Identify bottlenecks or underestimated tasks.

## 🎯 5. Evaluation  

### Why Evaluation Is Important  
Conducting thorough evaluations is a crucial step in user-centered game development. By collecting qualitative feedback early and iteratively, we can rapidly identify usability obstacles, refine our mechanics, and ensure that **Defend Bristol** meets real player expectations. It also helps prevent costly redesigns later on, aligning with industry best practices for delivering polished gaming experiences.


### Choosing a Qualitative Evaluation Method  

To explore how players truly experience our game, we considered two commonly used qualitative approaches:

| Method                  | Definition                                                                                      | Advantages                                                                                      | Limitations                                                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Heuristic Evaluation** | Experts inspect the game against established usability principles (Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics). | - Fast, low-cost, requires no external users. <br> - Systematically checks known interface issues. | - May miss authentic user reactions. <br> - Relies on expert assumptions, not real behavior.     |
| **Think Aloud Evaluation** | Real users verbalize their thoughts, decisions, and emotional reactions as they interact with the game. | - Provides direct insight into genuine user experiences. <br> - Small samples reveal big issues. | - Depends on participants’ willingness to talk. <br> - Some may find it awkward while playing. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac3e95a-6540-4727-ab81-e539cbcaca8b)

*Conclusion:*  
After weighing these methods, we concluded that observing actual players would yield richer, more actionable feedback. Therefore, we ultimately chose **Think Aloud** as our primary method to gain deeper insights into player behavior and emotional responses.


### Think Aloud Evaluation  

#### What Is Think Aloud?  
Think Aloud involves inviting participants to share their thoughts, feelings, and decision-making processes aloud as they perform tasks in the game. We observe them in real time, noting points of confusion, frustration, or excitement to understand how our design is interpreted by actual players.


#### Pros and Cons  

<div align="center">

| Pros                                         | Cons                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rich, Immediate Feedback** <br> See exactly where players stumble or succeed. | **Reliance on Participant Disclosure** <br> Shy players may hold back thoughts. |
| **Cost-Effective** <br> Requires minimal equipment and small participant groups. | **Less Natural Playing** <br> Continuous talking may break immersion. |

</div>



### 1. Planning a Think Aloud Evaluation  

We began by clarifying our key questions:

- *Can players figure out how to place and upgrade towers on their own?*  
- *Do they understand how the Knight absorbs a tower’s ability?*  
- *Are there any points of confusion about the interface or objectives?*
- *Can players intuitively grasp each tower’s unique function and counter mechanics?*
- *Is the economy system (gold/resources) transparent and balanced?*
- *Does the difficulty curve ease players in without early frustration?*

Based on these, we created tasks covering each core mechanic — starting a new game, placing a tower, upgrading, using the Knight to absorb abilities, and completing a wave.

Each session lasted 20–30 minutes with three participants:  
- 2 familiar with tower defense games  
- 1 completely new to the genre

  <i>Task List</i>
</p>

### 2. Carrying Out a Think Aloud Evaluation  

Roles:  
- 1 Facilitator(Siyuan Chen): explains the method and encourages thinking aloud.  
- 1 Observers(Yang Yang): take notes on participants' behaviors and comments.

Facilitator instructions example:  
> "There are no right or wrong answers — please share any thoughts or feelings you have as you play. If you fall silent for a while, I might gently ask what you’re thinking."

Prompt example (if silent too long):  
> "Could you talk me through your decision here?"


### 3. Analyzing a Think Aloud Evaluation  

We collected observation notes and categorized feedback into:  
- **Helpful Features**  
- **Confusing Elements**  
- **Suggestions for Improvement**  

#### Summary of Feedback  

| Category | Positive Feedback | Issues Identified | Suggestions for Improvement |
|----------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Map Interaction** | Historical map design is visually unique. | Difficulty distinguishing walkable areas vs. obstacles. | Highlight walkable areas (e.g., path glow or grid markers). |
| **Tower Management** | Grid-based placement feels intuitive. | Unclear upgrade paths; tower types lack visual differentiation. | Add tier icons/colors for upgrades; animate tower abilities on hover. |
| **Enemy Speed Adjustment** | Speed tweaks add strategic depth. | Confusion over whether changes apply to all enemies or just new waves. | Add real-time UI feedback (e.g., "Speed +10%: Affects ALL enemies"). |
| **UI Controls** | Layout is clean and navigable. | Ambiguous button functions (e.g., sell/upgrade). | Relabel buttons (e.g., "Sell Tower - 50% Refund"); add confirmation dialogs. |
| **Tower Function Clarity** | Tower variety provides interesting strategic options. | Players struggle to intuit tower abilities and counter mechanics. | Add tooltips with stats (e.g., "Slow Tower: Reduces speed by 30%") and enemy-type hints. |
| **Economy Transparency** | Resource system encourages thoughtful decision-making. | Gold/resource flow feels unbalanced; upgrades seem costly for marginal gains. | Show gold-per-wave previews; rebalance upgrade costs to align with power spikes. |
| **Difficulty Pacing** | Progressive challenge keeps players engaged. | Early waves are too punishing for new players. | Tune Wave 1-3 enemy health/density; add adaptive hints after failures. |
 
### Conclusion and Next Steps  

Based on the Think Aloud sessions, we identified key improvements:  

- **Improve Map Interaction**  
  - Highlight walkable areas to improve map readability and reduce player confusion.

- **Refine Tower Management Feedback**  
  - Add visible or audible cues when a tower upgrade is complete.  
  - Improve visual differentiation between tower types and upgrade paths.

- **Clarify Enemy Speed Adjustment**  
  - Provide clear feedback about the effect of speed-up.  
  - Add tooltips or hints when activating speed-up.

- **Refine Wave Alerts**  
  - Provide clearer indicators or countdowns before enemy spawning to help players prepare.

- **Clarify Knight Ability Absorption**  
  - Incorporate a progress bar or timer to show the absorption duration for better player feedback.

- **Refine UI Controls**  
  - Improve button labels for clarity.  
  - Add confirmation prompts for critical actions to prevent misclicks.
 


### Choosing a Quantitative Evaluation Method

While our Think Aloud sessions provided rich insights into **Defend Bristol**’s user experience, we also incorporated a standardized quantitative method to validate and measure specific aspects of player perception:

### NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX)

#### Purpose
Measure the perceived workload that players experience when performing core tasks in the game.

#### Method

We adopted a within-subjects design: each of the 10 participants played Easy, Mid, and Hard versions of Defend Bristol, then completed the NASA TLX after each session.
This allowed us to perform paired statistical analyses (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) and reduce the effect of individual differences on workload scores.

The NASA TLX evaluation is computed in two main steps:

1. **Determine Dimension Weights (Pairwise Comparisons):**  
   Each participant conducts 15 pairwise comparisons among the six dimensions:
   - **Mental Demand (MD)**
   - **Physical Demand (PD)**
   - **Temporal Demand (TD)**
   - **Performance (Perf)**
   - **Effort (Effort)**
   - **Frustration (Frust)**
   
   In each comparison, if a dimension is judged as more important for workload, it receives 1 point. As a result, each dimension’s weight is an integer between 0 and 5, and the sum of the weights for all six dimensions is always 15.

2. **Rate Each Dimension (0–100 Scale):**  
   Each participant then assigns a rating (from 0 to 100, usually in increments of 5) to each dimension.  
   Their **Weighted TLX Score** is calculated by multiplying each dimension’s rating by its individual weight, summing these products, and dividing by 15:

This breakdown reveals a progressive increase in mental, temporal, and effort-related workload with rising difficulty, and a decline in perceived performance, which aligns with expectations in usability studies.

#### Visualization of Weighted NASA TLX

To better visualize how different task dimensions contributed to perceived workload across difficulty levels, we computed the average weighted contribution of each TLX dimension for Easy, Mid, and Hard conditions.

<p align="center">

Figure: Average Weighted NASA TLX contribution per dimension across Easy, Mid, and Hard difficulty levels.

#### Statistical Significance: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Confidence Intervals

To assess whether workload differences across difficulty levels were statistically significant, we conducted paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests (α = 0.05) on participants' Weighted NASA TLX scores.

The analysis compares each participant’s workload between two conditions:

<div align="center">
  
| Comparison      | Mean Δ (TLX) | 95% CI (Diff)     | W (Wilcoxon) | *p*-value |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Mid − Easy      | **+22.64**   | [20.79, 24.49]    | 0            | 0.00195   |
| Hard − Mid      | **+21.76**   | [18.14, 25.38]    | 0            | 0.00195   |
| Hard − Easy     | **+44.40**   | [40.90, 47.90]    | 0            | 0.00195   |

</div>

All three comparisons show statistically significant differences (p < 0.01), with 95% confidence intervals that do not cross zero, confirming a progressive increase in perceived workload as task difficulty rises.

<p align="center">

</p>

These findings validate the sensitivity of the NASA TLX method and reinforce its reliability in detecting usability impacts across design conditions.

### Applying System Usability Survey (SUS) to a Tower Defense Game

#### Overview
This outlines the process of applying the System Usability Survey (SUS) to evaluate the usability of a tower defense game. The SUS is a standardized questionnaire used to assess the perceived usability of a system, providing a score between 0 and 100.

##### Step 1: Design the SUS Questionnaire
The SUS consists of 10 standard questions, but for this tower defense game, we adapt the questions to fit the gaming context. Below are the 5 questions shown in the image, adjusted for the game, rated on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). The full SUS would include all 10 questions, but we focus on these for brevity.

##### SUS Questionnaire for Tower Defense Game

| Question Number | Statement                                                                 | Scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1               | I think that I would like to play this tower defense game frequently.     | 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5                             |
| 2               | I found the game unnecessarily complex.                                   | 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5                             |
| 3               | I thought the game was easy to play.                                      | 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5                             |
| 4               | I think that I would need the support of a technical person to play this game. | 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5                             |
| 5               | I found the various functions in this game were well integrated.          | 1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5                             |
##### Step 2: Collect Responses
Distribute the survey to a sample of players after they have played the game. For this simulation, we assume 3 players provided the following responses:

| Question | Player 1 | Player 2 | Player 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Q1       | 4        | 3        | 5        |
| Q2       | 2        | 3        | 1        |
| Q3       | 3        | 4        | 4        |
| Q4       | 1        | 2        | 1        |
| Q5       | 4        | 4        | 5        |

##### Step 3: Calculate the SUS Score
SUS scoring involves adjusting the raw scores and calculating an overall usability score. For each player:

- For odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5): Subtract 1 from the score.
- For even-numbered questions (2, 4): Subtract the score from 5.
- Sum the adjusted scores for each player.
- Multiply the sum by 2.5 to get the SUS score (out of 100).
##### Player 1 Calculation
- Q1: 4 - 1 = 3
- Q2: 5 - 2 = 3
- Q3: 3 - 1 = 2
- Q4: 5 - 1 = 4
- Q5: 4 - 1 = 3
- Total = 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 15
- SUS Score = 15 * 2.5 = 37.5

##### Player 2 Calculation
- Q1: 3 - 1 = 2
- Q2: 5 - 3 = 2
- Q3: 4 - 1 = 3
- Q4: 5 - 2 = 3
- Q5: 4 - 1 = 3
- Total = 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13
- SUS Score = 13 * 2.5 = 32.5

##### Player 3 Calculation
- Q1: 5 - 1 = 4
- Q2: 5 - 1 = 4
- Q3: 4 - 1 = 3
- Q4: 5 - 1 = 4
- Q5: 5 - 1 = 4
- Total = 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 19
- SUS Score = 19 * 2.5 = 47.5

##### Average SUS Score
- Average = (37.5 + 32.5 + 47.5) / 3 = 39.17

##### Step 4: Analyze the Results
- The average SUS score is 39.17, which is below the typical benchmark of 68 for an acceptable system.
- **Interpretation**: The tower defense game has usability issues. Players found it somewhat complex (Q2) and not very easy to play (Q3). They also didn’t strongly want to play frequently (Q1).
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Simplify the game mechanics or improve the tutorial to reduce perceived complexity.
  2. Enhance the user interface to make controls more intuitive.
  3. Ensure game functions (e.g., tower placement, upgrades) feel cohesive, as integration scored relatively well (Q5).

##### Conclusion
Using SUS, we identified usability challenges in the tower defense game. The score of 39.17 indicates room for improvement, particularly in ease of use and reducing complexity. Further iterations and user testing are recommended.

##### Key Observations

- **Individual Calculations:**  
  Each participant’s weighted score is computed using their own pairwise comparison weights. Only after calculating these individual scores can we compute group-level averages.
- **Increasing Difficulty:**  
  Hard mode yields a significantly higher mean weighted score (~67.2) compared to Easy (~32.3), reflecting a much heavier perceived workload.
- **Dimension Impact:**  
  Dimensions with higher weights (e.g., Mental Demand and Effort) contribute more to the overall workload, pinpointing areas that might require targeted design improvements.
- **Advantage of Weighting:**  
  The weighted approach provides clarity on which aspects of the game most affect perceived workload, offering actionable insights for refining the experience.

### Sustainability
Sustainable Tower Defense: Applying the SuSAF Framework

#### 1. Project Overview
We apply the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SuSAF) to *Sustainable Towers*, a mobile tower defense game with single-player and multiplayer modes and leaderboards. Our goal is to improve its sustainability across five dimensions: Social, Environmental, Economic, Technical, and Individual.

##### 2.1 Step 1: Define Dimensions
- **Social**: Inclusivity and community impact.
- **Environmental**: Energy footprint.
- **Economic**: Economic fairness for players and developers.
- **Technical**: Long-term technical support.
- **Individual**: Player well-being and privacy.

##### 2.2 Step 2: Guiding Questions and Discussion
We ask one question per dimension to identify sustainability impacts.

###### Social
- **Question**: Does the game allow players to adjust difficulty for better accessibility?
  - **Answer**: No, the game has fixed difficulty levels, which may exclude less experienced players.

###### Environmental
- **Question**: Does the game consume excessive energy?
  - **Answer**: Yes, real-time rendering and servers use significant energy.

###### Economic
- **Question**: Does the game’s monetization model ensure fairness and sustainability for players and developers?
  - **Answer**: The game is free with no in-app purchases, but lacks alternative revenue streams, risking developer sustainability.

###### Technical
- **Question**: Is the game optimized for older devices?
  - **Answer**: No, older devices experience lag, leading to obsolescence.

###### Individual
- **Question**: Does the game encourage excessive playtime?
  - **Answer**: Yes, daily challenges may lead to overplaying.

##### 2.3 Step 3: Discussion Summary
We identify key impacts and long-term effects.

- **Social**: Fixed difficulty → Excludes beginners → Reduces inclusivity.
- **Environmental**: High energy use → Larger carbon footprint → Environmental harm.
- **Economic**: No revenue model → Developer funding issues → Potential abandonment.
- **Technical**: Poor optimization → Hardware upgrades → Increased e-waste.
- **Individual**: Daily challenges → Excessive play → Mental health risks.

##### 2.4 Step 4: User Stories
We create user stories to address the identified issues.

- **Social**: As a beginner player, I want adjustable difficulty levels, so I can enjoy the game at my skill level.
- **Environmental**: As a player, I want a low-power mode, so the game uses less energy.
- **Economic**: As a developer, I want a sustainable monetization model (e.g., optional ads), so the game remains viable without unfair costs to players.
- **Technical**: As a player with an older device, I want optimization, so I can play without lag.
- **Individual**: As a player, I want optional daily challenges, so I can manage my playtime.

##### 2.5 Step 5: SusAD Visualization
We score the game’s sustainability (out of 10):

- Social: 4
- Environmental: 3
- Economic: 4
- Technical: 4
- Individual: 5

### Integrating the Findings

By combining our qualitative insights (e.g., from Think Aloud sessions) with the quantitative Weighted NASA TLX scores (calculated individually and then averaged), we gain a comprehensive understanding of the player experience in **Defend Bristol**. This method allows us to pinpoint specific design components—such as UI feedback or difficulty balance—that may benefit from refinement, particularly under higher difficulty conditions.

**Conclusion:**  
Individual weighted TLX calculations provide a precise measure of workload. Aggregating these scores reveals a clear trend where increasing game difficulty leads to substantially higher perceived workload. Future design iterations will focus on reducing these excessive demands while preserving the desired challenge.
