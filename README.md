These landmarks are not just **visual elements** 👀 but play a **strategic role in defense** 🛡️, with some offering **unique defensive abilities** 🔥.  

By combining **historical authenticity** 📜 with **engaging gameplay** 🎮, we have created a **tower defense game unlike any other**—one that **challenges players strategically** 🧠 while also offering an **educational journey through time** ⏳📚.  


# 🎯 3. Requirements  

## 🏗️ Ideation Process - Game Concept Development 🎯  

### 💡 Early Brainstorming & Game Ideas  
During **Week 2**, our team (**which initially had 6 members**) brainstormed **two potential game concepts**:  

1. **🛡️ Tower Defense Game**  
   - A **historical tower defense game**, integrating **different defense strategies across various eras**.  
   - Players would be able to **place, upgrade, and manage towers** to defend against invaders from different time periods (e.g., knights ⚔️, pirates 🏴‍☠️, futuristic AI robots 🤖).  

2. **✈️ Aircraft Shooter Game**  
   - A **classic aerial shooter**, where players pilot an aircraft to **engage in air combat and eliminate enemies**.  
   - The game would feature multiple historical settings (e.g., **WWI, WWII, modern warfare, and futuristic battles**).  

### 📜 Paper Prototype Development  
To better understand and test the game mechanics, we created paper prototypes 📄🎲 for this as part of the early validation process：

       style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Stories & Stakeholders

In this phase, we identified the key **stakeholders** whose input and needs would directly influence the game's development. Our goal was to ensure the game appealed to a broad audience—both users and creators. The key stakeholders we focused on were:

- 🎮 **Players**: The main users who play the game.
- 🎨 **Game Designers**: Those who design levels and mechanics.
- 👩‍💻 **Developers**: Programmers implementing the game.
- 🐞 **QA Testers**: People testing for bugs and balance.
- 🖌️ **Artists**: Designers of game assets (characters, towers, environment).
- 🎶 **Sound Designers**: Those who create sound effects and music.
- 📅 **Project Managers**: Oversee development progress.
- 📢 **Marketing Team**: Promote the game to players.
- 💰 **Investors/Publishers**: Fund the project.
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Community Moderators**: Manage player discussions and feedback.

As we refined our ideas, we began developing **user stories** to ensure that our vision aligned with the experiences we wanted to deliver. These stories were crafted in **collaboration** with developers, designers, and artists, incorporating a variety of perspectives to make sure we were covering all aspects of the game.

  <i>Stakeholder Requirements</i>
</p>

### 🎨 Early Design & Prototyping  

In the early stages of design, we researched traditional tower defense games to understand their mechanics and identify potential areas for innovation. Our key decision was to merge tower defense gameplay with the historical evolution of Bristol, offering players the opportunity to enjoy the strategic gameplay while also learning about the city's history.

Once the core game concept was defined, we focused on establishing the key gameplay pillars. For example, tower placement would be strategically important, with different historical periods unlocking unique towers and monsters. We also aimed to incorporate Bristol's historical landmarks as key gameplay elements, enhancing both the strategic depth and the educational value of the game.

To ensure the game met these design goals, we also considered the system's technical requirements. The game needed to be accessible across multiple platforms, allowing players to engage on PC, console, and web. The user interface was designed to be intuitive, facilitating easy tower placement, upgrades, and resource management.

With these concepts in mind, we developed an early prototype, testing core gameplay mechanics such as grid-based tower placement, monster AI pathfinding, and resource management. These tests validated our ideas and ensured that the game could progress to full-scale development with a solid foundation.

UIManager → GameManager: Sends placement request
GameManager → TowerManager: Validates tower position
TowerManager → GameMap: Checks grid availability
GameMap → TowerManager: Returns result (success/fail)
TowerManager → GameManager: Confirms placement
GameManager → UIManager: Updates UI (tower placed)
```
## `Implement monster behavior lifecycle`

### State Diagram – Monster Behavior
~~~~plaintext
[Monster Spawned] → [Moving]  
[Moving] → (Hit by Tower) → [Taking Damage]  
[Taking Damage] → (Health > 0) → [Continue Moving]  
[Taking Damage] → (Health = 0) → [Monster Dies]  
[Monster Dies] → [Player Gains Reward]
~~~~

# 5. Implementation

feat: Implement game structure and core components

- Researched similar games and decided to divide the game into four main components: **map, towers, monsters, and the main interface**.
- Created four separate classes: **maps.js, tower.js, monster.js, and main.js**.
- Implemented core functionalities:
  - **Placing, purchasing, selling, and upgrading towers**.
  - **Pausing, starting, and resetting the game**.
  - **Speeding up monster movement**.
  - **Exiting and switching to the team interface**.

### Challenges

#### 1. Integrate Bristol landmarks with game map

- This was by far the hardest task: finding a way to seamlessly integrate **Bristol's landmarks** into a **tower defense-style game map**.
- We aimed to blend **Bristol’s unique elements** with the game’s mechanics while maintaining **strategic gameplay balance**.
- Implemented location-based tower placements to align with real-world landmarks.
- Designed custom textures and structures inspired by **Bristol’s architecture** to enhance immersion.

  <i>Map integrating Bristol MVB and Chemistry Buildings</i>
</p>

#### 1.1 Splitting Game Maps  
   We explored various methods to split existing tower defense maps and integrate them into our game. Using Python in combination with OpenCV and Matplotlib, we visualized the maps. After dozens of attempts, we ultimately decided on an 8-row by 12-column grid layout.

<p align="center">

  <i>Attempting to split tower defense game maps</i>
</p>

#### 1.2 Converting Images into a Cartoon Style  
At first, we attempted to embed the MVB and teaching buildings into the game images. However, we found that the styles were inconsistent. To resolve this, we explored various methods to convert images into a cartoon style. We tried multiple approaches, including using some software found on TikTok and features available on existing websites.

Ultimately, we decided to use a Photoshop plugin called Clone, which easily transforms images into a cartoon style. However, while integrating this plugin, we encountered the "Plugin is not properly signed" issue on Windows systems. To resolve this, we modified the Windows Registry Editor to successfully integrate the software.

</p>

#### 1.3 First Failed Attempt  
We attempted to insert the cartoonized MVB and Chemistry Building into our game map, but it was an obvious failure—the cartoonized images were 2D, while the game map was 2.5D. This initial setback was quite frustrating for us.

  <b>Figure 23</b><br>
  <i>First_Failed_Attempt</i>
</p>

#### 1.4 Final Work  
After a long period of consideration, we ultimately decided to convert the images into 2.5D. We tried another Photoshop plugin called 2.5D Generator 2, which allowed us to add depth to the images. After that, we adjusted the brightness to make the images blend better with the game map. We all agreed that the final result was highly satisfactory.

#### 2. Frame Animation Design
1. Frame Rate Optimization
- Choosing the right frame rate is crucial to balance smoothness and performance.
- Too low FPS results in choppy animations, while too high FPS can cause performance issues.

2. Sprite Sheet Management
- Efficiently organizing sprite sheets to reduce memory usage and rendering time.
- Ensuring correct frame alignment to avoid misalignment when drawing.
- Handling different frame sizes dynamically.

3. Directional Animations
- Designing animations for multiple directions (e.g., left, right, up, down).
- Avoiding redundant frames by flipping sprites instead of drawing extra frames.

4. Animation Timing and Synchronization
- Controlling frame transitions smoothly based on speed or events.
- Synchronizing animations with game physics (e.g., running, attacking, jumping).
- Ensuring consistent playback across different devices.

5. State Transitions and Blending
- Handling smooth transitions between animations (e.g., walking to running to idle).
- Avoiding sudden jumps or unnatural movements.
- Implementing animation blending for fluid motion.

2. **Level Design and balance**

   We realised early on that we wanted to build the level map in an extensible way, so the `Map` class contains a function that reads a text file representing the map (Figure 17). This allowed maximal flexibility whilst developing our maps, especially as core game mechanics like jump height were being changed. We opted not to use procedural generation, as we felt control was important given the puzzle-solving nature of the game. This is because we found that many decisions, like where a button is located, can profoundly affect a player's ability to complete a particular puzzle.

<p align="center">
  <b>Figure 17</b><br>
  <i>The level designer</i><br>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0kD1yRU.png" width="500" >
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Figure 18</b><br>
  <i>The level, as designed in Figure 17.</i><br>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Suklhby.png" width="500" >
</p>
    
   This level designer was very helpful when in playtesting. For example, one user found the jump in the tutorial level too challenging to complete, but with a few keystrokes, we were able to change it and immediately gather feedback that the same user found it easier.
   
3.1 **Accessibility:** *Performance Challenges*

<p align="center">
  <b>Figure 19</b><br>
  <i>Demonstration of Accessibility Use-Case.</i><br>
  <img src="Assets_For_ReadMe/Game_Video_V5.gif">
</p>
   Accessibility was a really important aspect for us, as we have team members with personal experience of their disability locking them out of games. So, we built a way to play the game without keyboard input (Figure 18). When planning this feature, we researched that this can be achieved where users with accessibility needs could lean left and right for player movement, and make a noise for the player to jump. To program this, we used the `Machine Vision` and `Audio` libraries, where input from the webcam is taken, and if the user's head is detected on one side of the screen, the character moves that way. Audio input was taken using Processing’s sound library, and if it spikes over a certain level a jump signal is sent to the player character. We found that the main challenge of this was efficiency affecting game performance, as the first library we used was too slow, as it was doing pose detection. We switched to just detecting the head position, and the game worked. 


3.2 **Accessibility:** *Linux Issues*

The other element of the game that evolved significantly was the interface for selecting disability mode. Through user testing, we discovered that the Processing `Video` library experiences issues on Linux. Rather than have an unplayable game on Linux, we load the library when the accessibility button is clicked. Our heuristic evaluation required us to include a dynamic loading screen (visibility of system status) since the library takes several seconds to initialise.

Clicking the accessibility button on Linux causes an error message to show up (Figure 20).
