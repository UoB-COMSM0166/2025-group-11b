🛡️ In designing our game, we set out to create a historically immersive tower defense experience that is both engaging and educational. 🌍 Our vision was to craft a game that combines strategy ♟️, progression 📈, and cultural significance 🏛️, allowing players to explore the rich history of Bristol while defending the city from various threats ⚔️ across different time periods ⏳.

## ⚔️ A Unique Twist on Tower Defense 🏹  
🕰️ Unlike traditional tower defense games that focus only on mechanics, our game integrates historical storytelling into the experience. Spanning multiple eras, from the medieval period ⚔️ to the high-tech future 🤖, players take on the role of a Guardian 👑, defending Bristol from invading armies, pirate raids, and cyber warfare across time.

- ⚔️ **Invading armies**  
- 🏴‍☠️ **Pirate raids**  
- 🖥️ **High-tech cyber warfare**  

🔥 Get ready to **defend, strategize, and experience history like never before!** 🔥

## 🏇 Knight Mechanic: Absorbing Tower Abilities ⚔️  

🏇 To tackle the common lack of player interaction in tower defense games, we introduced a medieval knight ⚔️ who can absorb a tower’s ability ✨ by staying nearby for 5 seconds ⏱️. The knight then fights alongside the tower, adding a dynamic and strategic layer as players guide him between different towers to combine powers and defeat enemies.

# 🎯 2. Requirements  

## 🏗️ Ideation Process - Game Concept Development 🎯  

### 💡 Early Brainstorming & Game Ideas  
During **Week 2**, our team (**which initially had 6 members**) brainstormed **two potential game concepts**:  

1. **🛡️ Tower Defense Game**  
   - A **historical tower defense game**, integrating **different defense strategies across various eras**.  
   - Players would be able to **place, upgrade, and manage towers** to defend against invaders from different time periods (e.g., knights ⚔️, pirates 🏴‍☠️, futuristic AI robots 🤖).  

2. **✈️ Aircraft Shooter Game**  
   - A **classic aerial shooter**, where players pilot an aircraft to **engage in air combat and eliminate enemies**.  
   - The game would feature multiple historical settings (e.g., **WWI, WWII, modern warfare, and futuristic battles**).  

### 📜 Paper Prototype Development  
To better understand and test the game mechanics, we created two paper prototypes 📄🎲 for this as part of the early validation process：
- #### Tower Defense Game Paper Prototype  
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-11b/blob/main/Early%20Design.gif"

       width="500" 
       style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

- #### Aircraft Shooter Game Paper Prototype  
<p align="center">

       alt="Aircraft Shooter Paper Prototype" 
       width="500" 
       style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

### 🤝 How We Decided as a Team What to Develop  (**which initially had 6 members**) 

- Open Brainstorming Sessions:  
  We first conducted open discussions where every team member pitched ideas, focusing on gameplay mechanics, target audiences, and possible historical or educational elements.

- Paper Prototype Feedback:  
  We created paper prototypes (see below) for both the Tower Defense Game and the Aircraft Shooter Game. By testing these prototypes in small play sessions, we gathered direct feedback on fun factor, ease of learning, and potential for expansion.

- Feasibility & Resource Assessment:  
  Given our team size and the complexity of each concept, we weighed the required development effort (e.g., coding complexity, art assets, AI pathfinding) against our available skills and time constraints.  
  The Tower Defense concept was deemed more feasible due to clearer scope definition and manageable AI requirements.

- Stakeholder & Audience Considerations:  
  We referred to our Onion Model of Stakeholders to anticipate who would be most invested in each idea. We also considered which concept might have broader appeal and educational potential.

- Final Team Vote & Milestone Check:  
  After considering feedback, testing the paper prototypes, and reviewing our resources, the team held a final vote. We chose the Tower Defense concept.



### 🧅 Onion Model of Stakeholders  

To better visualize the relationship between different stakeholders in our game project, we created an **Onion Model** to represent their roles and levels of involvement.

The model illustrates four concentric layers:  

- The innermost layer represents the **Players**, who directly interact with the game system.  
- The second layer includes the **Core Development Team** — Designers, Developers, Artists, and QA Testers — who build and test the game.  
- The third layer consists of the **Support & Management Team** — Project Managers, Sound Designers, and Community Moderators — who ensure project progress and community engagement.  
- The outermost layer features **External Stakeholders** — Marketing Team, Investors, Publishers, and Potential Partners — who promote, fund, and expand the game's reach.

### 🧩 Identify Top-Level User Needs

After analysing the project context and stakeholders' needs, we identified the top-level user requirements (Epics) that would guide our game development:

- Epic 1: Provide engaging gameplay with progressive difficulty.
- Epic 2: Allow players to explore historical periods through gameplay.
- Epic 3: Offer a variety of towers and enemy types to ensure diversity and replayability.
- Epic 4: Optimize game performance and stability across different devices.
- Epic 5: Create a scalable backend and infrastructure to support future updates and multiplayer functionality.


### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Stories & Stakeholders

In this phase, we identified the key **stakeholders** whose input and needs would directly influence the game's development. Our goal was to ensure the game appealed to a broad audience—both users and creators. The key stakeholders we focused on were:

- 🎮 **Players**: The main users who play the game.
- 🎨 **Game Designers**: Those who design levels and mechanics.
- 👩‍💻 **Developers**: Programmers implementing the game.
- 🐞 **QA Testers**: People testing for bugs and balance.
- 🖌️ **Artists**: Designers of game assets (characters, towers, environment).
- 🎶 **Sound Designers**: Those who create sound effects and music.
- 📅 **Project Managers**: Oversee development progress.
- 📢 **Marketing Team**: Promote the game to players.
- 💰 **Investors/Publishers**: Fund the project.
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Community Moderators**: Manage player discussions and feedback.

As we refined our ideas, we began developing **user stories** to ensure that our vision aligned with the experiences we wanted to deliver. These stories were crafted in **collaboration** with developers, designers, and artists, incorporating a variety of perspectives to make sure we were covering all aspects of the game.

  <b>Figure 5</b><br>
  <i>Stakeholder Requirements</i>
</p>

### 🧾 Specify Atomic Requirements  

To further refine our user needs, we specified atomic requirements based on our user stories. These requirements are clear, testable, and independent to ensure traceability and system verification.

#### Example Atomic Requirements:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| AR-01 | The system shall allow the player to place a tower on an empty grid. | Given the player has enough resources, when they select a grid, then the tower should be placed successfully. |
| AR-02 | The system shall allow the player to upgrade a tower to increase its attack damage. | Given the player selects an existing tower, when they choose upgrade, then the tower’s attack stats should increase. |
| AR-03 | The system shall spawn enemy waves with increasing difficulty. | Given the player starts a new wave, when the wave spawns, then enemy stats (speed, health, number) should increase. |
| AR-04 | The system shall display earned in-game currency when enemies are defeated. | Given an enemy is defeated, when the player views their resources, then the currency value should update accordingly. |



### 🎨 Early Design & Prototyping  

🔍 Research & Conceptualization
In the early stages of design, we researched traditional tower defense games to understand their mechanics and identify potential areas for innovation. Our key decision was to merge tower defense gameplay with the historical evolution of Bristol 🏛️, offering players the opportunity to enjoy strategic gameplay while also learning about the city's history.

🛠️ Core Gameplay Design
Once the core game concept was defined, we focused on establishing the key gameplay pillars. For example, tower placement would be strategically important, with different historical periods unlocking unique towers and monsters. We also aimed to incorporate Bristol's historical landmarks as key gameplay elements, enhancing both the strategic depth and the educational value of the game.

💻 Technical Considerations
To ensure the game met these design goals, we considered the system's technical requirements. The game needed to be accessible across multiple platforms (PC, console, and web) 🌐, allowing players to engage seamlessly. The user interface was designed to be intuitive, facilitating easy tower placement, upgrades, and resource management.

🚀 Prototype Development
With these concepts in mind, we developed an early prototype, testing core mechanics such as grid-based tower placement, monster AI pathfinding, and resource management. These tests validated our ideas and ensured that the game could progress to full-scale development with a solid foundation.

# 4. Implementation

feat: Implement game structure and core components

- Researched similar games and decided to divide the game into four main components: **map, towers, monsters, and the main interface**.
- Created four separate classes: **maps.js, tower.js, monster.js, and main.js**.
- Implemented core functionalities:
  - **Placing, purchasing, selling, and upgrading towers**.
  - **Pausing, starting, and resetting the game**.
  - **Speeding up monster movement**.
  - **Exiting and switching to the team interface**.

### Challenges

#### 1. Integrate Bristol landmarks with game map

- This was by far the hardest task: finding a way to seamlessly integrate **Bristol's landmarks** into a **tower defense-style game map**.
- We aimed to blend **Bristol’s unique elements** with the game’s mechanics while maintaining **strategic gameplay balance**.
- Implemented location-based tower placements to align with real-world landmarks.
- Designed custom textures and structures inspired by **Bristol’s architecture** to enhance immersion.

  <b>Figure 15</b><br>
  <i>Map integrating Bristol MVB and Chemistry Buildings</i>
</p>

#### 1.1 Splitting Game Maps  
   We explored various methods to split existing tower defense maps and integrate them into our game. Using Python in combination with OpenCV and Matplotlib, we visualized the maps. After dozens of attempts, we ultimately decided on an 8-row by 12-column grid layout.

<p align="center">

  <b>Figure 16</b><br>
  <i>Attempting to split tower defense game maps</i>
</p>

#### 1.2 Converting Images into a Cartoon Style  
At first, we attempted to embed the MVB and teaching buildings into the game images. However, we found that the styles were inconsistent. To resolve this, we explored various methods to convert images into a cartoon style. We tried multiple approaches, including using some software found on TikTok and features available on existing websites.

Ultimately, we decided to use a Photoshop plugin called Clone, which easily transforms images into a cartoon style. However, while integrating this plugin, we encountered the "Plugin is not properly signed" issue on Windows systems. To resolve this, we modified the Windows Registry Editor to successfully integrate the software.

</p>

#### 1.3 First Failed Attempt  
We attempted to insert the cartoonized MVB and Chemistry Building into our game map, but it was an obvious failure—the cartoonized images were 2D, while the game map was 2.5D. This initial setback was quite frustrating for us.

</p>

#### 1.4 Final Work  
After a long period of consideration, we ultimately decided to convert the images into 2.5D. We tried another Photoshop plugin called 2.5D Generator 2, which allowed us to add depth to the images. After that, we adjusted the brightness to make the images blend better with the game map. We all agreed that the final result was highly satisfactory.

#### 2. Frame Animation Design
1. Frame Rate Optimization
- Choosing the right frame rate is crucial to balance smoothness and performance.
- Too low FPS results in choppy animations, while too high FPS can cause performance issues.

2. Sprite Sheet Management
- Efficiently organizing sprite sheets to reduce memory usage and rendering time.
- Ensuring correct frame alignment to avoid misalignment when drawing.
- Handling different frame sizes dynamically.

3. Directional Animations
- Designing animations for multiple directions (e.g., left, right, up, down).
- Avoiding redundant frames by flipping sprites instead of drawing extra frames.

4. Animation Timing and Synchronization
- Controlling frame transitions smoothly based on speed or events.
- Synchronizing animations with game physics (e.g., running, attacking, jumping).
- Ensuring consistent playback across different devices.

5. State Transitions and Blending
- Handling smooth transitions between animations (e.g., walking to running to idle).
- Avoiding sudden jumps or unnatural movements.
- Implementing animation blending for fluid motion.

## 🎯 5. Evaluation  

### Why Evaluation Is Important  
Conducting thorough evaluations is a crucial step in user-centered game development. By collecting qualitative feedback early and iteratively, we can rapidly identify usability obstacles, refine our mechanics, and ensure that **Defend Bristol** meets real player expectations. It also helps prevent costly redesigns later on, aligning with industry best practices for delivering polished gaming experiences.


### 🔎 Choosing a Qualitative Evaluation Method  

To explore how players truly experience our game, we considered two commonly used qualitative approaches:

| Method                  | Definition                                                                                      | Advantages                                                                                      | Limitations                                                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Heuristic Evaluation** | Experts (or team members) inspect the game against established usability principles (e.g., Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics). | - Fast, low-cost, requires no external users. <br> - Systematically checks known interface issues. | - May miss authentic user reactions. <br> - Relies on expert assumptions, not real behavior.     |
| **Think Aloud Evaluation** | Real users verbalize their thoughts, decisions, and emotional reactions as they interact with the game. | - Provides direct insight into genuine user experiences. <br> - Small samples reveal big issues. | - Depends on participants’ willingness to talk. <br> - Some may find it awkward while playing.  |

> 📝 *Conclusion:*  
> After weighing these methods, we concluded that observing actual players would yield richer, more actionable feedback.  
> Therefore, we ultimately chose **Think Aloud** as our primary method to gain deeper insights into player behavior and emotional responses.


### 🗣️ Think Aloud Evaluation  

#### What Is Think Aloud?  
Think Aloud involves inviting participants to share their thoughts, feelings, and decision-making processes aloud as they perform tasks in the game. We observe them in real time, noting points of confusion, frustration, or excitement to understand how our design is interpreted by actual players.


#### Pros and Cons  

<div align="center">

| Pros                                         | Cons                                                                 |

### 1. Planning a Think Aloud Evaluation  

We began by clarifying our key questions:

- ⚔️ *Can players figure out how to place and upgrade towers on their own?*  
- 🤔 *Do they understand how the Knight absorbs a tower’s ability?*  
- ❓ *Are there any points of confusion about the interface or objectives?*  

Based on these, we created tasks covering each core mechanic — starting a new game, placing a tower, upgrading, using the Knight to absorb abilities, and completing a wave.

Each session lasted 20–30 minutes with three participants:  
- 2 familiar with tower defense games  
- 1 completely new to the genre

### 2. Carrying Out a Think Aloud Evaluation  

Roles:  
- 1 Facilitator: explains the method and encourages thinking aloud.  
- 1-2 Observers: take notes on participants' behaviors and comments.

Facilitator instructions example:  
> "There are no right or wrong answers — please share any thoughts or feelings you have as you play. If you fall silent for a while, I might gently ask what you’re thinking."

Prompt example (if silent too long):  
> "Could you talk me through your decision here?"


### 3. Analyzing a Think Aloud Evaluation  

We collected observation notes and categorized feedback into:  
- **Helpful Features**  
- **Confusing Elements**  
- **Suggestions for Improvement**  

#### Summary of Feedback  

| 😊 Positive Feedback                                        | ⚠️ Issues Identified                                              | 💡 Suggestions for Improvement                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "I love the Knight mechanic — it adds a fun strategic twist." | "I didn’t notice when the tower had finished upgrading."          | Add a sound effect or pop-up when upgrade completes.                  |
| "The historical vibe is awesome; it really makes the game stand out." | "Sometimes I wasn’t sure if the enemies had spawned yet."          | Add a countdown or alert at the start of each wave.                   |
| "Being able to place towers on a grid is intuitive."        | "I never realized how long the Knight must stand to absorb."       | Show a progress bar or timer for ability absorption.                  |


### 🎬 Conclusion and Next Steps  

Based on the Think Aloud sessions, we identified key improvements:  

- **Improve Upgrade Feedback**  
  - Add visible or audible cues when an upgrade is complete.

- **Refine Wave Alerts**  
  - Provide clearer indicators or countdowns for enemy spawning.

- **Clarify Knight Absorption**  
  - Incorporate a progress bar or timer for better feedback.

By addressing these areas, we believe **Defend Bristol** will offer an even more accessible and engaging tower defense experience — delighting both new and experienced players alike.
